title: Effective Sentence Scoring Method Using BERT for Speech Recognition
crossref: acml19
abstract: In automatic speech recognition, language models (LMs) have been used in
  many ways to improve performance. Some of the studies have tried to use bidirectional
  LMs (biLMs) for rescoring the $n$-best hypothesis list decoded from the acoustic
  model. Despite their theoretical advantages over conventional unidirectional LMs
  (uniLMs), previous biLMs have not given notable improvements compared to the uniLMs
  in the experiments. This is due to the architectural limitation that the rightward
  and leftward representations are not fused in the biLMs. Recently, BERT addressed
  the same issue by proposing the masked language modeling and achieved state-of-the-art
  performances in many downstream tasks by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT. In this
  paper, we propose an effective sentence scoring method by adjusting the BERT to
  the $n$-best list rescoring task, which has no fine-tuning step. The core idea of
  how we modify the BERT for the rescoring task is bridging the gap between training
  and testing environments by considering the only masked language modeling within
  a single sentence. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the
  proposed scoring method using our biLM outperforms uniLMs for the $n$-best list
  rescoring, consistently and significantly in all experimental conditions. Additionally,
  an analysis about where word errors occur in a sentence demonstrates that our biLM
  is more robust than the uniLM especially when a recognized sentence is short or
  a misrecognized word is at the beginning of the sentence. Consequently, we empirically
  prove that the left and right representations should be fused in biLMs for scoring
  a sentence.
