title: Multi-Label Learning with Regularization Enriched Label-Specific Features
crossref: acml19
abstract: Multi-label learning learns from examples each associated with multiple
  class labels simultaneously, and the goal is to induce a predictive model which
  can assign a set of relevant labels for the unseen instance. Label-specific features
  serve as an effective strategy towards inducing multi-label predictive model, where
  the relevancy of each class label is determined by employing tailored features encoding
  inherent and distinct characteristics of the class label its own. In this paper,
  a regularization based approach named {\textsc{Reel}} is proposed for label-specific
  features generation, which works by enriching label-specific feature representation
  for each class label via synergizing informative label-specific features from other
  class labels with sparse regularization. Specifically, full-order label correlations
  are considered by {\textsc{Reel}} while the number of classifiers induced for multi-label
  prediction is linear to the number of class labels. Extensive experiments on fifteen
  benchmark multi-label data sets clearly show the favorable performance of {\textsc{Reel}}
  against other state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches with label-specific
  features.
