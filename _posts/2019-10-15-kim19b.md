title: Forward-Backward Generative Adversarial Networks for Anomaly Detection
crossref: acml19
abstract: Generative adversarial network (GAN) has established itself as a promising
  model for density estimation, with its wide applications to various problems. Of
  particular interest in this paper is the problem of {\em anomaly detection} which
  involves identifying events that do not conform to expected patterns in data. Recent
  application of GANs to the task of anomaly detection, resort to their ability for
  learning probability distributions of normal examples, so that abnormal examples
  or outliers are detected when they reside in very low-probability regimes. Existing
  GAN methods often suffer from the bad {\em cycle-consistency} problem, which yields
  the large reconstruction error so that the anomaly detection performance is degraded.
  In order to alleviate this, we present a model that consists of a forward GAN and
  backward GAN, each of which has an individual discriminator, that are coupled by
  enforcing feature matching in two discriminators. We show that our forward-backward
  GANs (FBGANs) better captures the data distribution so that the anomaly detection
  performance is improved over existing GAN-based methods. Experiments on MNIST an
  KDD99 datasets demonstrate that our method, FBGANs, outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  anomaly detection methods, in terms of the area under precision recall curve (AUPR)
  and $F_{1}$-score.
