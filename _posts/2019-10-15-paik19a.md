title: Capsule Networks Need an Improved Routing Algorithm
crossref: acml19
abstract: In capsule networks, the routing algorithm connects capsules in consecutive
  layers, enabling the upper-level capsules to learn higher-level concepts by combining
  the concepts of the lower-level capsules. Capsule networks are known to have a few
  advantages over conventional neural networks, including robustness to 3D viewpoint
  changes and generalization capability. However, some studies have reported negative
  experimental results. Nevertheless, the reason for this phenomenon has not been
  analyzed yet. We empirically analyzed the effect of five different routing algorithms.
  The experimental results show that the routing algorithms do not behave as expected
  and often produce results that are worse than simple baseline algorithms that assign
  the connection strengths uniformly or randomly. We also show that, in most cases,
  the routing algorithms do not change the classification result but polarize the
  link strengths, and the polarization can be extreme when they continue to repeat
  without stopping. In order to realize the true potential of the capsule network,
  it is essential to develop an improved routing algorithm.
