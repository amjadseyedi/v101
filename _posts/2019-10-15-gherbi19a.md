title: An Encoding Adversarial Network for Anomaly Detection
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'Anomaly detection is a standard problem in Machine Learning with various
  applications such as health-care, predictive maintenance, and cyber-security. In
  such applications, the data is unbalanced: the rate of regular examples is much
  higher than the anomalous examples. The emergence of the Generative Adversarial
  Networks (GANs) has recently brought new algorithms for anomaly detection. Most
  of them use the generator as a proxy for the reconstruction loss. The idea is that
  the generator cannot reconstruct an anomaly. We develop an alternative approach
  for anomaly detection, based on an Encoding Adversarial Network (AnoEAN), which
  maps the data to a latent space (decision space), where the detection of anomalies
  is done directly by calculating a score. Our encoder is learned by adversarial learning,
  using two loss functions, the first constraining the encoder to project regular
  data into a Gaussian distribution and the second, to project anomalous data outside
  this distribution. We conduct a series of experiments on several standard bases
  and show that our approach outperforms the state of the art when using 10% anomalies
  during the learning stage, and detects unseen anomalies.'
