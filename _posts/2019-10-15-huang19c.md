title: An Anchor-Free Oriented Text Detector with Connectionist Text Proposal Network
crossref: acml19
abstract: Deep learning approaches have made great progress for the scene text detection
  in recent years. However, there are still some difficulties such as the text orientation
  and varying aspect ratios. In this paper, we address these issues by treating a
  text instance as a sequence of fine-scale proposals. The vertical distances from
  a text pixel to the text borders are directly regressed without the commonly used
  anchor mechanism, and then the small local proposals are connected during the post-processing.
  A U-shape convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used to incorporate
  the context information and detect small text instances. In experiments, the proposed
  approach, referred to as Anchor-Free oriented text detector with Connectionist Text
  Proposal Network (AFCTPN), achieves better or comparable performance with less time
  consumption on benchmark datasets.
