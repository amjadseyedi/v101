title: Stochastic Gradient Trees
crossref: acml19
abstract: We present an algorithm for learning decision trees using stochastic gradient
  information as the source of supervision. In contrast to previous approaches to
  gradient-based tree learning, our method operates in the incremental learning setting
  rather than the batch learning setting, and does not make use of soft splits or
  require the construction of a new tree for every update. We demonstrate how one
  can apply these decision trees to different problems by changing only the loss function,
  using classification, regression, and multi-instance learning as example applications.
  In the experimental evaluation, our method performs similarly to standard incremental
  classification trees, outperforms state of the art incremental regression trees,
  and achieves comparable performance with batch multi-instance learning methods.
