title: A Continuous Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Approach to Flocking with
  Fixed-Wing UAVs
crossref: acml19
abstract: Controlling a squad of fixed-wing UAVs is challenging due to the kinematics
  complexity and the environmental dynamics. In this paper, we develop a novel actor-critic
  reinforcement learning approach to solve the leader-follower flocking problem in
  continuous state and action spaces. Specifically, we propose a CACER algorithm that
  uses multilayer perceptron to represent both the actor and the critic, which has
  a deeper structure and provides a better function approximator than the original
  continuous actor-critic learning automation (CACLA) algorithm. Besides, we propose
  a double prioritized experience replay (DPER) mechanism to further improve the training
  efficiency. Specifically, the state transition samples are saved into two different
  experience replay buffers for updating the actor and the critic separately, based
  on the calculation of sample priority using the temporal difference errors. We have
  not only compared CACER with CACLA and a benchmark deep reinforcement learning algorithm
  DDPG in numerical simulation, but also demonstrated the performance of CACER in
  semi-physical simulation by transferring the learned policy in the numerical simulation
  without parameter tuning.
