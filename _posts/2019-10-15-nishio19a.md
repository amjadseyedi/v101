title: Random Projection in Neural Episodic Control
crossref: acml19
abstract: End-to-end deep reinforcement learning has enabled agents to learn with
  little preprocessing by humans. However, it is still difficult to learn stably and
  efficiently because the learning method usually uses a nonlinear function approximation.
  Neural Episodic Control (NEC), which has been proposed in order to improve sample
  efficiency, is able to learn stably by estimating action values using a non-parametric
  method. In this paper, we propose an architecture that incorporates random projection
  into NEC to train with more stability. In addition, we verify the effectiveness
  of our architecture by Atariâ€™s five games. The main idea is to reduce the number
  of parameters that have to learn by replacing neural networks with random projection
  in order to reduce dimensions while keeping the learning end-to-end.
