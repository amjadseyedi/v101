title: SDC-causing Error Detection Based on Lightweight Vulnerability Prediction
crossref: acml19
abstract: Nowadays the system vulnerability caused by soft errors grows exponentially,
  of which Silent Data Corruption(SDC) is one of the most harmful issues due to introducing
  unnoticed changes to the original data and error outputs. Thus, the detection of
  SDC-causing errors is extremely significant to the system reliability. However,
  most of the current detecting techniques require sufficient data of fault injections
  for training, which are difficult to achieve in practice because of high resources
  consumption, such as expensive execution time and code size costs. To this end,
  we propose a lightweight model named Deep Forest Regression based Multi-granularity
  Redundancy(DFRMR) to improve the error detection rate and meanwhile decrease the
  resources consumption. Specifically, first, we employ the program analysis to extract
  instruction features which are highly related to SDCs. Second, we design the deep
  forest regression model to predict the SDC vulnerability of instructions. Third,
  we optimize the error detection procedure by duplicating the critical instructions
  with different granularity. Finally, we evaluate our DFRMR model on Mibench benchmarks
  with multiple testing programs. The results show that our method attains better
  detection accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods and keeps the low
  multi-granularity redundancy.
