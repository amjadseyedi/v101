title: Self-Weighted Multi-View Clustering with Deep Matrix Factorization
crossref: acml19
abstract: Due to the efficiency of exploring multiple views of the real-word data,
  Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has attracted extensive attention from the scholars
  and researches based on it have made significant progress. However, multi-view data
  with numerous complementary information is vulnerable to various factors (such as
  noise). So it is an important and challenging task to discover the intrinsic characteristics
  hidden deeply in the data. In this paper, we present a novel MVC algorithm based
  on deep matrix factorization, named Self-Weighted Multi-view Clustering with Deep
  Matrix Factorization (SMDMF). By performing the deep decomposition structure, SMDMF
  can eliminate interference and reveal semantic information of the multi-view data.
  To properly integrate the complementary information among views, it assigns an automatic
  weight for each view without introducing supernumerary parameters. We also analyze
  the convergence of the algorithm and discuss the hierarchical parameters. The experimental
  results on four datasets show our algorithm is superior to other comparisons in
  all aspects.
