title: ResNet and Batch-normalization Improve Data Separability
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'The skip-connection and the batch-normalization (BN) in ResNet enable an
  extreme deep neural network to be trained with high performance. However, the reasons
  for its high performance are still unclear. To clear that, we study the effects
  of the skip-connection and the BN on the class-related signal propagation through
  hidden layers because a large ratio of the between-class distance to the within-class
  distance of feature vectors at the last hidden layer induces high performance. Our
  result shows that the between-class distance and the within-class distance change
  differently through layers: the deep multilayer perceptron with randomly initialized
  weights degrades the ratio of the between-class distance to the within-class distance
  and the skip-connection and the BN relax this degradation. Moreover, our analysis
  implies that the skip-connection and the BN encourage training to improve this distance
  ratio. These results imply that the skip-connection and the BN induce high performance.'
