title: Software Component Prediction for Bug Reports
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'In a software life cycle, bugs could happen at any time. Assigning bugs
  to relevant components/developers is a crucial task for software development. It
  is also a tough and resource consuming job. First, there are many components in
  a complex system and it is hard to understand their interactions and identify the
  root cause. Second, the list of components keeps growing for actively developed
  products and it is not easy to catch all updates. This task also faces several challenges
  from the machine learning point of view: 1) the ground truth is mixed with multiple
  levels of labels; 2) the data are severely imbalanced. 3). concept drift as future
  bugs are unlikely to come from the same distribution as the historical data. In
  this paper, we present a machine learning based solution for the bug assignment
  problem. We build component classifiers using a multi-layer Neural Network, based
  on features that were learned from data directly. A hierarchical classification
  framework is proposed to address the mixed label problem and improve the prediction
  accuracy. We also introduce a recency based sampling procedure to alleviate the
  data imbalance and concept drift problem. Our solution can easily accommodate new
  data and handle continuous system development/update.'
