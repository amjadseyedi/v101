title: 'From Implicit to Explicit Feedback: A deep neural network for modeling the
  sequential behavior of online users'
crossref: acml19
abstract: We demonstrate the advantages of taking into account multiple types of behavior
  in recommendation systems. Intuitively, each user has to do some \textbf{implicit}
  actions (e.g., click) before making an \textbf{explicit} decision (e.g., purchase).
  Previous works showed that implicit and explicit feedback has distinct properties
  to make a useful recommendation. However, these works exploit implicit and explicit
  behavior separately and therefore ignore the semantic of interaction between users
  and items. In this paper, we propose a novel model namely \textit{Implicit to Explicit
  (ITE)} which directly models the order of user actions. Furthermore, we present
  an extended version of ITE, namely \textit{Implicit to Explicit with Side information
  (ITE-Si)}, which incorporates side information to enrich the representations of
  users and items. The experimental results show that both ITE and ITE-Si outperform
  existing recommendation systems and also demonstrate the effectiveness of side information
  in two large scale datasets.
