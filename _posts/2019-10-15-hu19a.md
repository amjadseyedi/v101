title: Variational Conditional GAN for Fine-grained Controllable Image Generation
crossref: acml19
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel variational generator framework for conditional
  GANs to catch semantic details for improving the generation quality and diversity.
  Traditional generators in conditional GANs simply concatenate the conditional vector
  with the noise as the input representation, which is directly employed for upsampling
  operations. However, the hidden condition information is not fully exploited, especially
  when the input is a class label. Therefore, we introduce a variational inference
  into the generator to infer the posterior of latent variable only from the conditional
  input, which helps achieve a variable augmented representation for image generation.
  Qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the proposed method
  outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and achieves the realistic controllable
  images.
