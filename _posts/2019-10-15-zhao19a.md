title: Improving Relation Classification by Entity Pair Graph
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'Relation classification is one of the most important tasks in the field
  of information extraction, and also a key component of systems that require relational
  understanding of unstructured text. Existing relation classification approaches
  mainly rely on exploiting external resources and background knowledge to improve
  the performance and ignore the correlations between entity pairs which are helpful
  for relation classification. We present the concept of entity pair graph to represent
  the correlations between entity pairs and propose a novel entity pair graph based
  neural network (EPGNN) model, relying on graph convolutional network to capture
  the topological features of an entity pair graph. EPGNN combines sentence semantic
  features generated by pre-trained BERT model with graph topological features for
  relation classification. Our proposed model makes full use of a given corpus and
  forgoes the need of external resources and background knowledge. The experimental
  results on two widely used dataset: SemEval 2010 Task 8 and ACE 2005, show that
  our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.'
