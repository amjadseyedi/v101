title: Nuclei segmentation by using convolutional network with distance map and contour
  information
crossref: acml19
abstract: Accurate access to nuclear information on digital pathology images can assist
  physicians in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. The pathological images have a
  large number of nuclei and part of nuclei is touching, manual segmentation is time
  consuming and error prone. Therefore it is an important task to develop a accurate
  nuclei segmentation method. For traditional methods, it is hard to obtain a accurately
  nuclei segmentation result, because the nuclei have many different characterizations.
  In this paper, we propose a new nuclei segmentation method (MDC-Net), which is a
  deep fully convolutional network. The network contains multiple residual operations
  to reduce detail loss in image. In addition, dilated convolution which has different
  dilation ratio is used to increase receptive field. MDC-Net contains the distance
  map and contour image, enhancing information on individual nuclei to get accurate
  segmentation results. We improve the segmentation effect by using the post-processing
  operate. We demonstrate that MDC-Net can obtain state-of-the-art results on public
  dataset with multiple organ slices compared with other popular methods.
