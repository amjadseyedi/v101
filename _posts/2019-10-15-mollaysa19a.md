title: Learning to Augment with Feature Side-information
crossref: acml19
abstract: Multivariate time series prediction has recently attracted extensive research
  attention due to its wide applications in the area of financial investment, energy
  consumption, environmental pollution and so on. Because of the temporal complexity
  and nonlinearity existing in multivariate time series, few existing models could
  provide satisfactory prediction results. In this paper, we proposed a novel prediction
  approach based on optimized temporal convolutional networks with stacked auto-encoders,
  which can achieve better prediction performance as demonstrated in the experiments.
  Stacked auto-encoders are employed to extract effective features from complex multivariate
  time series. A temporal convolutional network is then constructed serving as the
  prediction model, which has a flexible receptive field and enjoys faster training
  speed with parallel computing ability than recurrent neural networks. The optimal
  hyperparameters in these models are discovered by Bayesian optimization. We performed
  extensive experiments by comparing the proposed algorithms and other popular algorithms
  on three different datasets, where the proposed approach obtain the best prediction
  results in various prediction horizons. In addition, we carefully analyze the search
  process of Bayesian optimization and provide further insights into hyperparametric
  tuning processes combining the exploration strategy with the exploitation strategy.
