title: A Model of Text-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Representation Learning with Collaborative
  Attention
crossref: acml19
abstract: This paper proposes a novel collaborative attention mechanism, to fully
  utilize the mutually reinforcing relationship among the knowledge graph representation
  learning procedure (i.e., structure representation) and textual relation representation
  learning procedure (i.e., text representation). Based on this collaborative attention
  mechanism, a text-enhanced knowledge graph (KG) representation model is proposed,
  which could utilize textual information to enhance the knowledge representations
  and make the multi-direction signals to be fully integrated to learn more accurate
  textual representations for further improving structure representation and vice
  versa. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model on
  both link prediction task and triple classification task.
