title: Kernel Learning for Data-Driven Spectral Analysis of Koopman Operators
crossref: acml19
abstract: Spectral analysis of the Koopman operators is a useful tool for studying
  nonlinear dynamical systems and has been utilized in various branches of science
  and engineering for purposes such as understanding complex phenomena and designing
  a controller. Several methods to compute the Koopman spectral analysis have been
  studied, among which data-driven methods are attracting attention. We focus on one
  of the popular data-driven methods, which is based on the Galerkin approximation
  of the operator using a basis estimated in a data-driven manner via the diffusion
  maps algorithm. The performance of this method with a finite amount of data depends
  on the choice of the kernel function used in diffusion maps, which creates a need
  for kernel selection. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the kernel function
  adaptively to obtain better performance in approximating spectra of the Koopman
  operator using the Galerkin approximation with diffusion maps. The proposed method
  depends on the multiple kernel learning scheme, and our objective function is based
  on the idea that a diffusion operator should commute with the Koopman operator.
  We also show the effectiveness of the proposed method empirically with numerical
  examples.
