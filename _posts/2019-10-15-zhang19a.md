title: 'Cascaded and Dual: Discrimination Oriented Network for Brain Tumor Classification'
crossref: acml19
abstract: Medical image classification is one of the fundamental research topics in
  the domain of computer-aided diagnosis. Although existing classification models
  of the natural image can produce promising results using deep convolutional neural
  networks in some cases, it is difficult to guarantee that these models can generate
  promising performance for medical images. To bridge such a gap, we propose a novel
  medical image classification method for brain tumors in this paper, termed as Discrimination
  Oriented Network (DONet). Inspired by the attention learning mechanism of the human
  brain, we first propose two categories of attention learning modules, i.e., the
  Cascaded Attention Learning (CAL) and the Dual Attention Learning (DAL), which can
  learn the discrimination information in both the spatial-wise and the channel-wise
  dimensions in a fine-grained manner. By the CAL and the DAL, the attention information
  of different dimensions is calculated in a series manner (for cascaded) and a parallel
  manner (for dual), respectively. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
  modules, we implement the CAL and the DAL on the Deep Residual Network (ResNet)
  for brain tumor classification. Compared with the ResNet, experimental results show
  that the DONet has a significant improvement in accuracy. Moreover, compared with
  state-of-the-art classification methods, the DONet can also achieve better performance.
