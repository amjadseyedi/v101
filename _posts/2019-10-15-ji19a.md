title: Differentially Private Community Detection in Attributed Social Networks
crossref: acml19
abstract: Community detection is an effective approach to unveil social dynamics among
  individuals in social networks. In the literature, quite a few algorithms have been
  proposed to conduct community detection by exploiting the topology of social networks
  and the attributes of social actors. In practice, community detection is usually
  conducted by third parties like advertisement companies, hospitals, with access
  to social networks for different purposes, which can easily lead to privacy breaches.
  In this paper, we investigate community detection in social networks aiming to protect
  the privacy of both the network topologies and the usersâ€™ attributes. In particular,
  we propose a new scheme called differentially private community detection (DPCD).
  DPCD detects communities in social networks via a probabilistic generative model,
  which can be decomposed into subproblems solved by individual users. The private
  social relationships and attributes of each user are protected by objective perturbation
  with differential privacy guarantees. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental
  validation using synthetic and real world social networks, we demonstrate that the
  proposed DPCD scheme detects social communities under modest privacy budget.
