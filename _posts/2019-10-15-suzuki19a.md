title: Hyperbolic Ordinal Embedding
crossref: acml19
abstract: Given ordinal relations such as the object $i$ is more similar to $j$ than
  $k$ is to $l$, ordinal embedding is to embed these objects into a low-dimensional
  space with all ordinal constraints preserved. Although existing approaches have
  preserved ordinal relations in Euclidean space, whether Euclidean space is compatible
  with true data structure is largely ignored, although it is essential to effective
  embedding. Since real data often exhibit hierarchical structure, it is hard for
  Euclidean space approaches to achieve effective embeddings in low dimensionality,
  which incurs high computational complexity or overfitting. In this paper we propose
  a novel hyperbolic ordinal embedding (HOE) method to embed objects in hyperbolic
  space. Due to the hierarchy-friendly property of hyperbolic space, HOE can effectively
  capture the hierarchy to achieve embeddings in an extremely low-dimensional space.
  We have not only theoretically proved the superiority of hyperbolic space and the
  limitations of Euclidean space for embedding hierarchical data, but also experimentally
  demonstrated that HOE significantly outperforms Euclidean-based methods.
