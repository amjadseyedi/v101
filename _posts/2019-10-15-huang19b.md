title: Efficient Diversified Mini-Batch Selection using Variable High-layer Features
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been widely adopted in training Deep
  Neural networks of various structures. Instead of using a full dataset, a so-called
  {\itshape mini-batch} is selected during each gradient descent iteration. This aims
  to speed up the learning when a large number of training data is present. Without
  the knowledge of its true underlying distribution, one often samples the data indices
  uniformly. Recently, researchers applied a diversified mini-batch selection scheme
  through the use of Determinantal Point Process (DPP), in order to avoid having highly
  correlated samples in one batch ({{Zhang etÂ al.}} ({2017})). Despite its success,
  the attempts were restrictive in the sense that they used fixed features to construct
  the Gram-matrix for DPP; using the raw or fixed higher-layer features limited the
  amount of potential improvement over the convergence rate. In this paper, we instead
  proposed to use variable higher-layer features which are updated at each iteration
  when the parameter changes. To avoid the high computation cost, several contributions
  have been made to speed up the computation of DPP sampling, including: (1) using
  hierarchical sampling to break down a single DPP sampling with large Gram-matrix
  into many DPP samplings of much smaller Gram-matrix and (2) using Markov k-DPP to
  encourage diversity across iterations. Empirical results show a much more diversified
  mini batch in each iteration in addition to a much improved convergence compared
  with the previous approach.'
