title: Multiple Empirical Kernel Learning with Discriminant Locality Preservation
crossref: acml19
abstract: Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithm effectively combines different
  kernels to improve the performance of classification. Most MKL algorithms implicitly
  map samples into feature space by the form of inner-product. In contrast, Multiple
  Empirical Kernel Learning (MEKL) can explicitly map the input spaces into feature
  spaces so that the mapped feature vectors are explicitly represented, which is easy
  to process and analyze the adaptability of kernels for input space. Meanwhile, in
  order to pay attention to the structure and discriminant information of samples
  in empirical feature space, inspired by discriminant locality preserving projections,
  we introduce the discriminant locality preservation regularization into MEKL framework
  to propose the Multiple Empirical Kernel Learning with Discriminant Locality Preservation
  (MEKL-DLP). Experiments conducted on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness
  of the proposed MEKL-DLP compared with the classical kernel-based algorithms and
  state-of-art MKL algorithms.
