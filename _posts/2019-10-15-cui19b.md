title: Multi-width Activation and Multiple Receptive Field Networks for Dynamic Scene
  Deblurring
crossref: acml19
abstract: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-width activation and multiple
  receptive field networks for the large-scale and complicated dynamic scene deblurring.
  Firstly, we design a multi-width activation feature extraction module, in which
  a multi-width activation residual block is proposed for making the activation function
  learn more the nonlinear information and extracting wider nonlinear features. Secondly,
  we design a multiple receptive field (RF) feature extraction module, in which a
  multiple RF residual block is proposed for enlarging the RF efficiently and capturing
  more nonlinear information from distant locations. And then, we design the multi-scale
  feature fusion module, where a learning fusion structure is designed to adaptively
  fuse the multi-scale features and complicated blur information from the different
  modules. Finally, we use a multi-component loss function to jointly optimize our
  networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
  the recent state-of-the-art deblurring methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
