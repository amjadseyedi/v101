title: 'G-UAP: Generic Universal Adversarial Perturbation that Fools RPN-based Detectors'
crossref: acml19
abstract: Adversarial perturbation constructions have been demonstrated for object
  detection, but these are image-specific perturbations. Recent works have shown the
  existence of image-agnostic perturbations called universal adversarial perturbation
  (UAP) that can fool the classifiers over a set of natural images. In this paper,
  we extend this kind perturbation to attack deep proposal-based object detectors.
  We present a novel and effective approach called G-UAP to craft universal adversarial
  perturbations, which can explicitly degrade the detection accuracy of a detector
  on a wide range of image samples. Our method directly misleads the Region Proposal
  Network (RPN) of the detectors into mistaking foreground (objects) for background
  without specifying an adversarial label for each target (RPNâ€™s proposal), and even
  without considering that how many objects and object-like targets are in the image.
  The experimental results over three state-of-the-art detectors and two datasets
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and transferability of the
  universal perturbations.
