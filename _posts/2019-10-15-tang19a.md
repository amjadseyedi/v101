title: An Articulated Structure-aware Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation
crossref: acml19
abstract: In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end articulated structure-aware network
  to regress 3D joint coordinates from the given 2D joint detections. The proposed
  method is capable of dealing with hard joints well that usually fail existing methods.
  Specifically, our framework cascades a refinement network with a basic network for
  two types of joints, and employs a attention module to simulate a camera projection
  model. In addition, we propose to use a random enhancement module to intensify the
  constraints between joints. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and HumanEva databases
  demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed network, and errors
  of hard joints and bone lengths are significantly reduced, compared with state-of-the-art
  approaches.
