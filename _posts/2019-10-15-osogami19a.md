  Pommerman Competition'
crossref: acml19
abstract: Autonomous agents need to make decisions in a sequential manner, under partially
  observable environment, and in consideration of how other agents behave. In critical
  situations, such decisions need to be made in real time for example to avoid collisions
  and recover to safe conditions. We propose a technique of tree search where a deterministic
  and pessimistic scenario is used after a specified depth. Because there is no branching
  with the deterministic scenario, the proposed technique allows us to take into account
  the events that can occur far ahead in the future. The effectiveness of the proposed
  technique is demonstrated in Pommerman, a multi-agent environment used in a NeurIPS
  2018 competition, where the agents that implement the proposed technique have won
  the first and third places.
