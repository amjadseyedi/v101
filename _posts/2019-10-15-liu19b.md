title: Unpaired Data based Cross-domain Synthesis and Segmentation Using Attention
  Neural Network
crossref: acml19
abstract: Medical images from different modalities (e.g. MRI, CT) or contrasts (e.g.
  T1, T2) are usually used to extract abundant information for medical image analysis.
  Some modalities or contrasts may be degraded or missing, caused by artifacts or
  strict timing during acquisition. Thus synthesizing realistic medical images in
  the required domain is meaningful and helpful for clinical application. Meanwhile,
  due to the time-consuming of manual annotation, automatic medical image segmentation
  has attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end cross-domain
  synthesis and segmentation framework SSA-Net. It is based on cycle generative adversarial
  network (CycleGAN) for unpaired data. We introduce a gradient consistent term to
  refine the boundaries in synthesized images. Besides, we design a special shape
  consistent term to constrain the anatomical structure in synthesized images and
  to guide segmentation without target domian labels. In order to make the synthesis
  subnet focusing on some hard-to-learn regions automatically, we also introduce the
  attention block into the generator. On two challenging validation datasets (CHAOS
  and iSeg-2017), the proposed method achieves superior synthesis performance and
  comparable segmentation performance.
