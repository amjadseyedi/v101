abstract: 'This paper presents a method which extracts informative features while
  selecting simultaneously adequate representations for Time Series Classification.
  This method simultaneously (i) selects alternative representations, such as derivatives,
  cumulative integrals, power spectrum … (ii) and extracts informative features (via
  automatic variable construction) from the selected set of representations. The suggested
  approach is decomposed in three steps: (i) the original time series are transformed
  into several representations which are stored as relational data; (ii) then, a {regularized}
  propositionalisation method is applied in order to generate informative aggregate
  features; (iii) finally, a selective Naive Bayes classifier is learned from the
  outcoming feature-value data table. The previous steps are repeated by a forward
  backward selection algorithm in order to select the most informative subset of representations.
  The suggested approach proves to be highly competitive when compared with state-of-the-art
  methods while extracting interpretable features. Furthermore, the suggested approach
  is almost parameter free and only requires few hardware resources.'
