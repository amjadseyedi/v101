title: 'SPCDet: Enhancing Object Detection with Combined Feature Fusing'
crossref: acml19
abstract: Feature pyramid and feature fusing are widely used in object detection.
  Using feature pyramid can confront the challenge of scale variation across different
  objects. Feature fusing imports context information to improve detection performance.
  Although detecting with feature pyramid and feature fusing has achieved some encouraging
  results, there are still some limitations owing to the featuresâ€™ level variance
  among different layers. In this paper, we exploit that serial-parallel combined
  feature fusing can enhance object detection. Instead of detecting on the feature
  pyramid of backbone directly, we fuse different layers from backbone as base features.
  Then the base features are fed into a U-shape module to build local-global feature
  pyramid. At last, we use the pyramid to do the multi-scale detection with our combined
  feature fusing method. We call this one-stage detector SPCDet. It keeps real time
  speed and outperforms other detectors in trade-off between accuracy and speed.
