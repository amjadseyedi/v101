title: Minimax Online Prediction of Varying Bernoulli Process under Variational Approximation
crossref: acml19
abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) is an important class of machine learning
  problems that come with a wide spectrum of applications, each demanding a possibly
  different evaluation criterion. When solving the MLC problems, we generally expect
  the learning algorithm to take the hidden correlation of the labels into account
  to improve the prediction performance. Extracting the hidden correlation is generally
  a challenging task. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework to
  better extract the hidden correlation with the help of the memory structure within
  recurrent neural networks. The memory stores the temporary guesses on the labels
  and effectively allows the framework to rethink about the goodness and correlation
  of the guesses before making the final prediction. Furthermore, the rethinking process
  makes it easy to adapt to different evaluation criteria to match real-world application
  needs. In particular, the framework can be trained in an end-to-end style with respect
  to any given MLC evaluation criteria. The end-to-end design can be seamlessly combined
  with other deep learning techniques to conquer challenging MLC problems like image
  tagging. Experimental results across many real-world data sets justify that the
  rethinking framework indeed improves MLC performance across different evaluation
  criteria and leads to superior performance over state-of-the-art MLC algorithms.
