title: Functional Isolation Forest
crossref: acml19
abstract: For the purpose of monitoring the behavior of complex infrastructures (\textit{e.g.}
  aircrafts, transport or energy networks), high-rate sensors are deployed to capture
  multivariate data, generally unlabeled, in quasi continuous-time to detect quickly
  the occurrence of anomalies that may jeopardize the smooth operation of the system
  of interest. The statistical analysis of such massive data of functional nature
  raises many challenging methodological questions. The primary goal of this paper
  is to extend the popular {\scshape Isolation Forest} (IF) approach to Anomaly Detection,
  originally dedicated to finite dimensional observations, to functional data. The
  major difficulty lies in the wide variety of topological structures that may equip
  a space of functions and the great variety of patterns that may characterize abnormal
  curves. We address the issue of (randomly) splitting the functional space in a flexible
  manner in order to isolate progressively any trajectory from the others, a key ingredient
  to the efficiency of the algorithm. Beyond a detailed description of the algorithm,
  computational complexity and stability issues are investigated at length. From the
  scoring function measuring the degree of abnormality of an observation provided
  by the proposed variant of the IF algorithm, a \textit{Functional Statistical Depth}
  function is defined and discussed, as well as a multivariate functional extension.
  Numerical experiments provide strong empirical evidence of the accuracy of the extension
  proposed.
