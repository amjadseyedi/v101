title: Variational Inference from Ranked Samples with Features
crossref: acml19
abstract: In many supervised learning settings, elicited labels comprise pairwise
  comparisons or rankings of samples. We propose a Bayesian inference model for ranking
  datasets, allowing us to take a probabilistic approach to ranking inference. Our
  probabilistic assumptions are motivated by, and consistent with, the so-called Plackett-Luce
  model. We propose a variational inference method to extract a closed-form Gaussian
  posterior distribution. We show experimentally that the resulting posterior yields
  more reliable ranking predictions compared to predictions via point estimates.
