title: A New Multi-choice Reading Comprehension Dataset for Curriculum Learning
crossref: acml19
abstract: The past few years have witnessed the rapid development of machine reading
  comprehension (MRC), especially the challenging sub-task, multiple-choice reading
  comprehension (MCRC). And the release of large scale datasets promotes the research
  in this field. Yet previous methods have already achieved high accuracy of the MCRC
  datasets, \textit{e.g.} RACE. It’s necessary to propose a more difficult dataset
  which needs more reasoning and inference for evaluating the understanding capability
  of new methods. To respond to such demand, we present RACE-C, a new multi-choice
  reading comprehension dataset collected from college English examinations in China.
  And further we integrate it with RACE-M and RACE-H, collected by {{Lai et al.}}
  ({2017}) from middle and high school exams respectively, to extend RACE to be RACE++.
  Based on RACE++, we propose a three-stage curriculum learning framework, which is
  able to use the best of the characteristic that the difficulty level within these
  three sub-datasets is in ascending order. Statistics show the higher difficulty
  level of our collected dataset, RACE-C, compared to RACE’s two sub-datasets, \textit{i.e.},
  RACE-M and RACE-H. And experimental results demonstrate that our proposed three-stage
  curriculum learning approach improves the performance of the machine reading comprehension
  model to an extent.
