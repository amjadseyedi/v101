title: Text Length Adaptation in Sentiment Classification
crossref: acml19
abstract: Can a text classifier generalize well for datasets where the text length
  is different? For example, when short reviews are sentiment-labeled, can these transfer
  to predict the sentiment of long reviews (i.e., short to long transfer), or vice
  versa? While unsupervised transfer learning has been well-studied for cross domain/lingual
  transfer tasks, \textbf{Cross Length Transfer} (CLT) has not yet been explored.
  One reason is the assumption that length difference is trivially transferable in
  classification. We show that it is not, because short/long texts differ in context
  richness and word intensity. We devise new benchmark datasets from diverse domains
  and languages, and show that existing models from similar tasks cannot deal with
  the unique challenge of transferring across text lengths. We introduce a strong
  baseline model called \textsc{BaggedCNN} that treats long texts as bags containing
  short texts. We propose a state-of-the-art CLT model called \textbf{Le}ngth \textbf{Tra}nsfer
  \textbf{Net}work\textbf{s} (\textsc{LeTraNets}) that introduces a two-way encoding
  scheme for short and long texts using multiple training mechanisms. We test our
  models and find that existing models perform worse than the \textsc{BaggedCNN} baseline,
  while \textsc{LeTraNets} outperforms all models.
