title: "$\\mathcal{X}$-Armed Bandits: Optimizing Quantiles, CVaR and Other Risks"
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'We propose and analyze StoROO, an algorithm for risk optimization on stochastic
  black-box functions derived from StoOO. Motivated by risk-averse decision making
  fields like agriculture, medicine, biology or finance, we do not focus on the mean
  payoff but on generic functionals of the return distribution. We provide a generic
  regret analysis of StoROO and illustrate its applicability with two examples: the
  optimization of quantiles and CVaR. Inspired by the bandit literature and black-box
  mean optimizers, StoROO relies on the possibility to construct confidence intervals
  for the targeted functional based on random-size samples. We detail their construction
  in the case of quantiles, providing tight bounds based on Kullback-Leibler divergence.
  We finally present numerical experiments that show a dramatic impact of tight bounds
  for the optimization of quantiles and CVaR.'
