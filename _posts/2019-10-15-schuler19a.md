title: Gradient-based Training of Slow Feature Analysis by Differentiable Approximate
  Whitening
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'We propose Power Slow Feature Analysis, a gradient-based method to extract
  temporally slow features from a high-dimensional input stream that varies on a faster
  time-scale, as a variant of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) that allows end-to-end training
  of arbitrary differentiable architectures and thereby significantly extends the
  class of models that can effectively be used for slow feature extraction. We provide
  experimental evidence that PowerSFA is able to extract meaningful and informative
  low-dimensional features in the case of (a) synthetic low-dimensional data, (b)
  ego-visual data, and also for (c) a general dataset for which symmetric non-temporal
  similarities between points can be defined. '
