title: Realistic Image Generation using Region-phrase Attention
crossref: acml19
abstract: The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has achieved remarkable progress
  in generating synthetic images from text, especially since the use of the attention
  mechanism. The current state-of-the-art algorithm applies attentions between individual
  regular-grid regions of an image and words of a sentence. These approaches are sufficient
  to generate images that contain a single object in its foreground. However, natural
  languages often involve complex foreground objects and the background may also constitute
  a variable portion of the generated image. In this case, the regular-grid region
  based image attention weights may not necessarily concentrate on the intended foreground
  region(s), which in turn, results in an unnatural looking image. Additionally, individual
  words such as “a”, “blue” and “shirt” do not necessarily provide a full visual context
  unless they are applied together. For this reason, in our paper, we proposed a novel
  method in which we introduced an additional set of natural attentions between object-grid
  regions and word phrases. The object-grid region is defined by a set of auxiliary
  bounding boxes. They serve as superior location indicators to where the alignment
  and attention should be drawn with the word phrases. We perform experiments on the
  Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) dataset and prove that our proposed
  approach is capable of generating more realistic images compared with the current
  state-of-the-art algorithms.
