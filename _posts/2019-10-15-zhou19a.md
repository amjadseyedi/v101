title: 'LADet: A Light-weight and Adaptive Network for Multi-scale Object Detection'
crossref: acml19
abstract: Scale variation is one of the most significant challenges for object detection
  task. In comparison with previous one-stage object detectors that simply make feature
  pyramid network deeper without consideration of speed, we propose a novel one-stage
  object detector called LADet, which consists of two parts, Adaptive Feature Pyramid
  Module(AFPM) and Light-weight Classification Function Module(LCFM). Adaptive Feature
  Pyramid Module generates complementary semantic information for each level feature
  map by jointly utilizing multi-level feature maps from backbone network, which is
  different from the top-down manner. Light-weight Classification Function Module
  is able to exploit more type of anchor boxes without a dramatic increase of parameters
  because of the utilization of interleaved group convolution. Extensive experiments
  on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a better
  trade-off between accuracy and efficiency over the comparable state-of-the-art detection
  methods.
