title: 'Convolutional Neural Collaborative Filtering with Stacked Embeddings '
crossref: acml19
abstract: Recommender System plays an important role in keeping people engaged with
  online services, and collaborative filtering is a main technique for recommendation.
  With the immense influence of deep learning, there is a growing interest in applying
  it to collaborative filtering. Existing methods have applied different ways to learn
  the user-item interaction function, however, most of these methods have limitation
  in modeling user-item correlations because they ignore the original user-item information
  and the large size of embeddings. In this work we propose Stacked Embedding Convolutional
  Neural Collaborative Filtering (SECNCF), a novel neural collaborative filtering
  architecture. The idea is to create a pedrail by stacking embeddings which are composed
  of user embedding, item embedding and latent factors. We apply convolutional neural
  network (CNN) above the pedrail layer to capture the local features of dimension
  correlations. This method is good at extracting rich local dimension correlations
  of embeddings and is scalable for modeling user-item interactions. Extensive experiments
  on three public accessible datasets show that our method makes significant improvement
  over the state-of-the-art methods.
