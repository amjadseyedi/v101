title: Self-Paced Multi-Label Learning with Diversity
crossref: acml19
abstract: The major challenge of learning from multi-label data has arisen from the
  overwhelming size of label space which makes this problem NP-hard. This problem
  can be alleviated by gradually involving easy to hard tags into the learning process.
  Besides, the utilization of a diversity maintenance approach avoids overfitting
  on a subset of easy labels. In this paper, we propose a self-paced multi-label learning
  with diversity (SPMLD) which aims to cover diverse labels with respect to its learning
  pace. In addition, the proposed framework is applied to an efficient correlation-based
  multi-label method. The non-convex objective function is optimized by an extension
  of the block coordinate descent algorithm. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets
  with different dimensions of features and labels imply the effectiveness of the
  proposed predictive model.
