title: Adaptive truncated residual regression for fine-grained regression problems
crossref: acml19
abstract: Recently, anchor-based regression methods have been applied to challenging
  regression problems, e.g., object detection and distance estimation, and greatly
  improved those performances. The key idea of anchor-based regression is to solve
  the regression of the residuals between selected anchors and original target variable,
  where the variance is expected to be smaller. However, similar to an ordinary regression
  method, the anchor-based regression could face difficulty on a fine-grained regression
  and ill-posed problems where the residual variables tend to be too small and complicated
  to accurately predict. To overcome these problems on the anchor-based regression,
  we propose to introduce an adaptive residual encoding in which the too small residual
  is magnified, and the too-large residual is truncated using adaptively tuned sigmoidal
  function. Our proposed method, called ATR-Nets (Adaptive Truncated Residual-Networks)
  with an end-to-end architecture could control the range of the target residual to
  be fitted based on the regression performance, Through experiments with toy-data
  and the system identification for earthquake asperity models, we show the effectiveness
  of our proposed method.
