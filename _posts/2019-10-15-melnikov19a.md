title: 'Learning to Aggregate: Tackling the Aggregation/Disaggregation Problem for
  OWA'
crossref: acml19
abstract: The problem of “learning to aggregate” (LTA) has recently been introduced
  as a novel machine learning setting, in which instances are represented in the form
  of a composition of a (variable) number on constituents. Such compositions are associated
  with an evaluation, which is the target of the prediction task, and which can presumably
  be modeled in the form of a suitable aggregation of the properties of its constituents.
  An especially interesting class of LTA problems arises when the evaluations of the
  constituents are not available at training time, and instead ought to be learned
  simultaneously with the aggregation function. This scenario is referred to as the
  “aggregation/disaggregation problem”. In this paper, we tackle this problem for
  an interesting type of aggregation function, namely the Ordered Weighted Averaging
  (OWA) operator. In particular, we provide an algorithm for learning the OWA parameters
  together with local utility scores of the constituents, and evaluate this algorithm
  in a case study on predicting the performance of classifier ensembles.
