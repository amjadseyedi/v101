title: Exemplar Based Mixture Models with Censored Data
crossref: acml19
abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that can handle censored data, data collected
  under the condition that the exact value is recorded only when the value is within
  a certain range, abbreviated information is recorded otherwise. It is known that
  existing methods that use mixture models with censored data suffer from (i) the
  existence of local optimum solutions and (ii) the need to compute the statistics
  of truncated distributions for parameter estimation. Our proposal, exemplar based
  censored mixture model (EBCM), overcomes these two difficulties at once by adopting
  the exemplar based model approach. The effectiveness of EBCM is confirmed by experiments
  on synthetic and real world dat sets.
