title: Learning Weighted Top-$k$ Support Vector Machine
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'Nowadays, the top-$k$ accuracy is a major performance criterion when benchmarking
  multi-class classifier using datasets with a large number of categories. Top-$k$
  multiclass SVM has been designed with the aim to minimize the empirical risk based
  on the top-$k$ accuracy. There already exist two SDCA-based algorithms to learn
  the top-$k$ SVM, enjoying several preferable properties for optimization, although
  both the algorithms suffer from two disadvantages. A weak point is that, since the
  design of the algorithms are specialized only to the top-$k$ hinge, their applicability
  to other variants is limited. The other disadvantage is that both the two algorithms
  cannot attain the optimal solution in most cases due to their theoritical imperfections.
  In this study, a weighted extension of top-$k$ SVM is considered, and novel learning
  algorithms based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is devised. The new learning algorithms
  possess all the favorable properties of SDCA as well as the applicability not only
  to the original top-$k$ SVM but also to the weighted extension. Geometrical convergence
  is achieved by smoothing the loss functions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
  only the proposed Frank-Wolfe algorithms can converge to the optimum, in contrast
  with the failure of the two existing SDCA-based algorithms. Finally, our analytical
  results for these two studies are presented to shed light on the meaning of the
  solutions produced from their algorithms. '
