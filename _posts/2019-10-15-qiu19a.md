title: Prediction of Crowd Flow in City Complex with Missing Data
crossref: acml19
abstract: Crowd flow forecasting plays an important role in risk assessment and public
  safety. It is a difficult task due to complex spatial-temporal dependencies as well
  as missing values in data. A number of models are proposed to predict crowd flow
  on city-scale, yet the missing pattern in city complex environment is seldomly considered.
  We propose a crowd flow forecasting model, Imputed Spatial-Temporal Convolution
  network(ISTC) to accurately predict the crowd flow in large complex buildings. ISTC
  uses convolution layers, whose structures are configured by graphs, to model the
  spatial-temporal correlations. Meanwhile ISTC adds imputation layers to handle the
  missing data. We demonstrate our model on several real data sets collected from
  sensors in a large six-floor commercial complex building. The results show that
  ISTC outperforms the baseline methods and is capable of handling data with as much
  as 40% missing data.
