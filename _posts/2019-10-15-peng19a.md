title: Investigating the effect of novel classes in semi-supervised learning
crossref: acml19
abstract: Semi-supervised learning usually assumes the distribution of the unlabelled
  data to be the same as that of the labelled data. This assumption does not always
  hold in practice. We empirically show that unlabelled data containing novel examples
  and classes from outside the distribution of the labelled data can lead to a performance
  degradation for semi-supervised learning algorithms. We propose a 1-nearest-neighbour
  based method to assign a weight to each unlabelled example in order to reduce the
  negative effect of novel classes in unlabelled data. Experimental results on MNIST,
  Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets suggest that the negative effect of novel classes
  becomes statistically insignificant when the proposed method is applied. Using our
  proposed technique, models trained on unlabelled data with novel classes can achieve
  similar performance as ones trained on clean unlabelled data.
