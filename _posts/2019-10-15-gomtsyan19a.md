title: Geometry-Aware Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Intrinsic Dimension
crossref: acml19
abstract: The existing approaches to intrinsic dimension estimation usually are not
  reliable when the data are nonlinearly embedded in the high dimensional space. In
  this work, we show that the explicit accounting to geometric properties of unknown
  support leads to the polynomial correction to the standard maximum likelihood estimate
  of intrinsic dimension for flat manifolds. The proposed algorithm (GeoMLE) realizes
  the correction by regression of standard MLEs based on distances to nearest neighbors
  for different sizes of neighborhoods. Moreover, the proposed approach also efficiently
  handles the case of nonuniform sampling of the manifold. We perform a series of
  experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that
  our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also being robust to
  noise in the data and competitive computationally.
