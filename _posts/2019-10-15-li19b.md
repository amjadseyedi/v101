title: Separate Loss for Basic and Compound Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild
crossref: acml19
abstract: In the past few years, facial expression recognition has made great progress
  because of the development of convolutional neural networks. However, the features
  learned only using the softmax loss are not discriminative enough for highly accurate
  facial expression recognition in the wild, especially for the compound facial expression
  recognition. To enhance the discriminative power of the learned features, we propose
  the separate loss for both basic and compound facial expression recognition in the
  wild in this paper. Such loss maximizes intra-class similarity while minimizing
  the similarity between different classes. The qualitative and quantitative analysis
  shows that the features learned using such loss function are characterized by intra-class
  compactness and inter-class separation. Experiments are performed on two databases
  in the wild and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on both basic
  and compound expressions. Furthermore, another two databases are used to perform
  cross database experiments to show the generalization ability of our method.
