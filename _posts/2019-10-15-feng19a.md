title: Improving Statute Prediction via Mining Correlations between Statutes
crossref: acml19
abstract: The task of statute prediction focuses on determining applicable statutes
  for legal cases with the inputs of fact descriptions, which is crucial for both
  legal experts and ordinary people without professional knowledge. Existing works
  just consider the correspondence from facts to individual statutes and ignore the
  correlations between statutes. Moreover, charges of cases have associations with
  statutes. To address these issues, we formulate statute prediction task as a sequence
  generation problem and propose a novel joint generative model to mine correlations
  between statutes. By integrating statute prediction task and charge prediction task,
  we also make model learn associations between statutes and charges. Experiments
  show our model outperforms several baselines significantly and correlative statutes
  are predicted accurately.
