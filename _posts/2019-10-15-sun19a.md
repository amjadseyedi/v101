title: Self-Supervised Deep Multi-View Subspace Clustering
crossref: acml19
abstract: As a new occurring unsupervised method, multi-view clustering offers a good
  way to investigate the hidden structure from multi-view data and attracts extensive
  attention in the community of machine learning and data mining. One popular approach
  is to identify a common latent subspace for capturing the multi-view information.
  However, these methods are still limited due to the unsupervised learning process
  and suffer from considerable noisy information from different views. To address
  this issue, we present a novel multi-view subspace clustering method, named self-supervised
  deep multi-view subspace clustering (\textbf{S2DMVSC}). It seamlessly integrates
  spectral clustering and affinity learning into a deep learning framework. \textbf{S2DMVSC}
  has two main merits. One is that the clustering results can be sufficiently exploited
  to supervise the latent representation learning for each view (via a classification
  loss) and the common latent subspace learning (via a spectral clustering loss) for
  multiple views. The other is that the affinity matrix among data objects is automatically
  computed according to the high-level and cluster-driven representation. Experiments
  on two scenarios, including original features and multiple hand-crafted features,
  demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art baselines.
