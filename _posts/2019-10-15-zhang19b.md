title: An Attentive Memory Network Integrated with Aspect Dependency for Document-Level
  Multi-Aspect Sentiment Classification
crossref: acml19
abstract: Document-level multi-aspect sentiment classification is one of the foundational
  tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and neural network methods have achieved
  great success in reviews sentiment classification. Most of recent works ignore the
  relation between different aspects and do not take into account the contexting dependent
  importance of sentences and aspect keywords. In this paper, we propose an attentive
  memory network for document-level multi-aspect sentiment classification. Unlike
  recent proposed models which average word embeddings of aspect keywords to represent
  aspect and utilize hierarchical architectures to encode review documents, we adopt
  attention-based memory networks to construct aspect and sentence memories. The recurrent
  attention operation is employed to capture long-distance dependency across sentences
  and obtain aspect-aware document representations over aspect and sentence memories.
  Then, incorporating the neighboring aspects related information into the final aspect
  rating predictions by using multi-hop attention memory networks. Experimental results
  on two real-world datasets TripAdvisor and BeerAdvocate show that our model achieves
  state-of-the-art performance.
