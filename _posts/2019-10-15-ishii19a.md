title: Zero-shot Domain Adaptation Based on Attribute Information
crossref: acml19
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation method that can be applied
  without target data. We consider the situation where domain shift is caused by a
  prior change of a specific factor and assume that we know how the prior changes
  between source and target domains. We call this factor an attribute, and reformulate
  the domain adaptation problem to utilize the attribute prior instead of target data.
  In our method, the source data are reweighted with the sample-wise weight estimated
  by the attribute prior and the data themselves so that they are useful in the target
  domain. We theoretically reveal that our method provides more precise estimation
  of sample-wise transferability than a straightforward attribute-based reweighting
  approach. Experimental results with both toy datasets and benchmark datasets show
  that our method can perform well, though it does not use any target data.
