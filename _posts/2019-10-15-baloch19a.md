title: 'Focused Anchors Loss: cost-sensitive learning of discriminative features for
  imbalanced classification'
crossref: acml19
abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) usually suffer performance penalties when there
  is a skewed label distribution. This phenomenon, class-imbalance, is most often
  mitigated peripheral to the classification algorithm itself, usually by modifying
  the amount of examples per class, for oversampling at the expense of computational
  efficiency, and for undersampling at the expense of statistical efficiency. In our
  solution, we combine discriminative feature learning with cost-sensitive learning
  to tackle the class imbalance problem by using a two step loss function, which we
  call the Focused Anchors loss (FAL). We evaluate FAL and its variant, Focused Anchor
  Mean Loss (FAML), on $6$ different datasets in comparison of traditional cross entropy
  loss and we observe a significant gain in balanced accuracy for all datasets. We
  also perform better than time-costly re-sampling and ensemble methods like SMOTE
  and Near Miss in $4$ out of $6$ datasets across F1-score, AUC-ROC and balanced accuracy.
  We also extend our evaluation to image domain and use long-tailed CIFAR$10$ to evaluate
  our loss function where we consistently report significant improvement in accuracy.
  We then go on to test our loss function under extreme imbalance on a propriety dataset
  and achieve a gain of $0.1$ AUC-ROC over the baseline.
