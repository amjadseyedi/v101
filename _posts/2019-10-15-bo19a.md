title: Latent Multi-view Semi-Supervised Classification
crossref: acml19
abstract: To explore underlying complementary information from multiple views, in
  this paper, we propose a novel Latent Multi-view Semi-Supervised Classification
  (LMSSC) method. Unlike most existing multi-view semi-supervised classification methods
  that learn the graph using original features, our method seeks an underlying latent
  representation and performs graph learning and label propagation based on the learned
  latent representation. With the complementarity of multiple views, the latent representation
  could depict the data more comprehensively than every single view individually,
  accordingly making the graph more accurate and robust as well. Finally, LMSSC integrates
  latent representation learning, graph construction, and label propagation into a
  unified framework, which makes each subtask optimized. Experimental results on real-world
  benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
