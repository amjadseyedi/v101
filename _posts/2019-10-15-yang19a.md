  Reinforcement Learning'
crossref: acml19
abstract: We tackle the blackbox issue of deep neural networks in the settings of
  reinforcement learning (RL) where neural agents learn towards maximizing reward
  gains in an uncontrollable way. Such learning approach is risky when the interacting
  environment includes an expanse of state space because it is then almost impossible
  to foresee all unwanted outcomes and penalize them with negative rewards beforehand.
  We propose Action-conditional $\beta$-VAE (AC-$\beta$-VAE) that allows succinct
  mappings of action-dependent factors in desirable dimensions of latent representations
  while disentangling environmental factors. Our proposed method tackles the blackbox
  issue by encouraging an RL policy network to learn interpretable latent features
  by distinguits influenshing ices from uncontrollable environmental factors, which
  closely resembles the way humans understand their scenes. Our experimental results
  show that the learned latent factors not only are interpretable, but also enable
  modeling the distribution of entire visited state-action space. We have experimented
  that this characteristic of the proposed structure can lead to ex post facto governance
  for desired behaviors of RL agents.
