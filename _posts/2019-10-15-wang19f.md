title: Forward and Backward Knowledge Transfer for Sentiment Classification
crossref: acml19
abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning a sequence of sentiment classification
  tasks. The learned knowledge from each task is retained and later used to help future
  or subsequent task learning. This learning paradigm is called \textit{lifelong learning}.
  However, existing lifelong learning methods either only transfer knowledge forward
  to help future learning and do not go back to improve the model of a previous task
  or require the training data of the previous task to retrain its model to exploit
  backward/reverse knowledge transfer. This paper studies reverse knowledge transfer
  of lifelong learning. It aims to improve the model of a previous task by leveraging
  future knowledge without retraining using its training data, which is challenging
  now. In this work, this is done by exploiting a key characteristic of the generative
  model of naïve Bayes. That is, it is possible to improve the naïve Bayesian classifier
  for a task by improving its model parameters directly using the retained knowledge
  from other tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method markedly outperforms
  existing lifelong learning baselines.
