title: 'SPoD-Net: Fast Recovery of Microscopic Images Using Learned ISTA'
crossref: acml19
abstract: 'Recovering high quality images from microscopic observations is an essential
  technology in biological imaging. Existing recovery methods require solving an optimization
  problem by using iterative algorithms, which are computationally expensive and time
  consuming. The focus of this study is to accelerate the image recovery by using
  deep neural networks (DNNs). In our approach, we first train a certain type of DNN
  by using some observations from microscopes, so that it can well approximate the
  image recovery process. The recovery of a new observation is then computed thorough
  a single forward propagation in the trained DNN. In this study, we specifically
  focus on observations obtained by SPoD (Super-resolution by Polarization Demodulation),
  a recently developed microscopic technique, and accelerate the image recovery for
  SPoD by using DNNs. To this end, we propose \emph{SPoD-Net}, a specifically tailored
  DNN for fast recovery of SPoD images. Unlike general DNNs, SPoD-Net can be parameterized
  using a small number of parameters, which is helpful in two ways: (i) it can be
  stored in a small memory, and (ii) it can be trained efficiently. We also propose
  a method to stabilize the training of SPoD-Net. In the experiments with the real
  SPoD observations, we confirmed the effectiveness of SPoD-Net over existing recovery
  methods. Specifically, we observed that SPoD-Net could recover images with more
  than a hundred times faster than the existing method.'
