title: Canonical Soft Time Warping
crossref: acml19
abstract: Alignment of two given sequences (i.e., computing correspondence between
  frames considering local time shifting) is a fundamental operation for various applications
  such as computer vision and bioinformatics. To obtain an alignment between high-dimensional
  sequences, several methods have been proposed, including canonical time warping
  (CTW). However, the optimization problem for CTW, and its extensions, often fall
  into poor local minima when the initial solution is far from the global optima.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{canonical soft time warping (CSTW)} in which an
  alignment is modeled as a probabilistic variable that follows the Gibbs distribution
  with temperature $\gamma$. We also propose the annealing CSTW (ACTW), a variant
  of CSTW that gradually decreases $\gamma$. ACTW is useful when underlying applications
  require hard alignments. Using synthetic and real-world data, we experimentally
  demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform previous methods, including CTW,
  in estimating alignments. In particular, our method does not suffer from poor local
  minima, as a consequence of the probabilistic treatment of alignments.
