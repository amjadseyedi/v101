title: Multi-modal Representation Learning for Successive POI Recommendation
crossref: acml19
abstract: Successive POI recommendation is a fundamental problem for location-based
  social networks (LBSNs). POI recommendation takes a variety of POI context information
  (e.g. spatial location and textual comment) and user preference into consideration.
  Existing POI recommendation systems mainly focus on part of the POI context and
  user preference with a specific modeling, which loses valuable information from
  other aspects. In this paper, we propose to construct a multi-modal check-in graph,
  a heterogeneous graph that combines five check-in aspects in a unified way. We further
  propose a multi-modal representation learning model based on the graph to jointly
  learn POI and user representations. Finally, we employ an attentional recurrent
  neural network based on the representations for successive POI recommendation. Experiments
  on a public dataset studies the effects of modeling different aspects of check-in
  records and demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in improving POI recommendation
  performance.
