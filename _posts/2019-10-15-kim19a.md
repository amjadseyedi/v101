title: Trust Region Sequential Variational Inference
crossref: acml19
abstract: Stochastic variational inference has emerged as an effective method for
  performing inference on or learning complex models for data. Yet, one of the challenges
  in stochastic variational inference is handling high-dimensional data, such as sequential
  data, and models with non-differentiable densities caused by, for instance, the
  use of discrete latent variables. In such cases, it is challenging to control the
  variance of the gradient estimator used in stochastic variational inference, while
  low variance is often one of the key properties needed for successful inference.
  In this work, we present a new algorithm for stochastic variational inference of
  sequential models which trades off bias for variance to tackle this challenge effectively.
  Our algorithm is inspired by variance reduction techniques in reinforcement learning,
  yet it uniquely adopts their key ideas in the context of stochastic variational
  inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through formal analysis
  and experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
