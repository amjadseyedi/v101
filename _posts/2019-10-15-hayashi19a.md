title: Active Change-Point Detection
crossref: acml19
abstract: We introduce Active Change-Point Detection (ACPD), a novel active learning
  problem for efficient change-point detection in situations where the cost of data
  acquisition is expensive. At each round of ACPD, the task is to adaptively determine
  the next input, in order to detect the change-point in a black-box expensive-to-evaluate
  function, with as few evaluations as possible. We propose a novel framework that
  can be generalized for different types of data and change-points, by utilizing an
  existing change-point detection method to compute change scores and a Bayesian optimization
  method to determine the next input. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed
  framework in different settings of datasets and change-points, using synthetic data
  and real-world data, such as material science data and seafloor depth data.
