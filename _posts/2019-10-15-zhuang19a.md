title: Multi-branch Siamese Network for High Performance Online Visual Tracking
crossref: acml19
abstract: Recently, Siamese networks have drawn great attention in the visual tracking
  community because of their balanced accuracy and speed. However, most existing Siamese
  frameworks describe the target appearance using a global pattern from the last layer,
  leading to high sensitivity to similar distractors, non-rigid appearance change,
  and partial occlusion. Addressing these issues, we propose a Multi-branch Siamese
  network (MSiam) for high-performance object tracking. The MSiam performs layer-wise
  feature aggregations and simultaneously considers the global-local patterns for
  more accurate target tracking. In particular, we propose a feature aggregation module
  (FAM) keeping the heterogeneity of the three types of features, further improving
  the discriminability of MSiam using both high-level semantic and low-level spatial
  information. To enhance the adaptability to non-rigid appearance change and partial
  occlusion, a multi-scale local pattern detection module (LPDM) is designed to identify
  discriminative regions of the target objects. By considering various combinations
  of the local structures, our tracker can form various types of structure patterns.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed tracking
  algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods while running beyond
  real-time.
